As midi is a compressed format of musical data, it lack a significant amount of information compared to audio files []. Especially for drums, the differences between modern pop songs are not most prominent in the patterns itself, but rather in the dynamics and voicings of the musician, which results in differences in timbre (frequency, spectrum). There are much more differences in the rythms itself between different genres (e.g. pop, jazz, metal, world). Therefore this is chosen.
- drum-midi collection: 800.000 midifiles (loops + songs), different sources + styles

MusicVAE
 - quantized (16th notes), this causes the output to always be in time
  - no triplets
  - no swing/shuffle/laid-back
 for e.g. the closed hihat, the model can always predict a value of 1.0 and the output can still be musical
 alt: higher samplerate, less quantization, more sparse matrices


latent space
 - normaal veel samples nodig (variatie)
  - maar met hierarchical model hoeft dat niet


evaluatie ~ analytisch

softmax ouptut for poly data?

sparse matrices?
 - musicVAE was quantized to 16ths

normalize




Hypothesis testing
 - experimental
 - analytical (+ part experimental)


How much quantization can be used while maintaining musical qualities 
What effect has quantization on ..
e.g. dilla analysis


data
 - limit variance: e.g. 2 'pure' genres (e.g. typical rock beat)
   - instead of class probabilities, latent variabels become scalars for musical features that are present in one or more genres (e.g. hh density)
 - then interpolations becomes more meaningfull


Subjects ~ style transfer
 - melodies
 - sparse matrices ~ swing, shuffle
 - rdf, semantic ...
 - psychology/perception: conv. based network vs capsule based
  - independent identification and property detection
  - vector graphics
 - practical application?
