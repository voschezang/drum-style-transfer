So far
	convert midi to matrices
	unsipervised, autoencoder, normal + lstm
		few drumloops as input
    high accuracy, but not 100% (perhaps due to lack of training epochs)

problems
  definitions of note-indices change between sources - note-64 can be a snare/tom/hh 
   - relative note values are meaningless
     (stil, often bassdrum is the lowest note)

todo
  train first AE on a single track
   - then use second AE to encode relations between tracks
   - beware: holism, perhaps the musical structure cannot be fully learned by deconstruction the parts individually
  cascades / recursive search
    functions that compute frequencies
      encoder can encode more important information
      decoder can use these layers in parallel, and then use maxpooling to combine layers

	(optional) sparse matrices (scipy/tensorflow)
		batch generator to convert the current batch to a dense matrix
		e.g. sparse column matrix

  compress data: convolution layers to reduce the dimensionality (actually, speed up the tempo)
    then an AE trained on 2Hz data, can also predict 1Hz data

id:
  simulate recorders with multiple sample rates,
  by using LSTM networks with different input windows
  - just like with recording
  - so that multiple patterns with different frequences can be analysed
  	e.g. HH of 2 Hz, BD of 0.25 Hz
  	e.g. 3 over 2


alt encoding
    list of length(max notes per some t)
        [(A1, 0.3),(B1, 0.4)]
          note = vector127





Database

database van drumloops - genoeg keuze, maar geen structuur in labels etc (veel overlappende labels)

noten corresponderen niet met instrumenten
 - no inherent difference between HH, OH



variational ae
change encoder:
       [ [ occurences per instance ] per note ]
       then use conv layers to decrease the amount of nodes
       (notes are considered to be independent instruments)
       combine the nodes post, with some sparse layers (conv removes too much info)


large amount (10k) of inputs
 - hierarchical softmax, negative sampling
